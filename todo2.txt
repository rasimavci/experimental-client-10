CODE PROBLEMS & IMPROVEMENS
-----------------------------------------------

history page infinite scrolling, currently brings 50 items, should bring more when scroll bar reachs end

**Cordova Issues**
call or IM not working in real mobile
cordova plugins should be integrated

incoming call not working, it needs to be done
improve incoming call notification UI
improve incoming call notification logic (notification queue for incoming IM)


cordova call should be integrated, similar call.page to sr1 website
