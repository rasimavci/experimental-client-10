"code issues"...

favorites - needs a service,
presences - show contact presences in contacts page

"UI"....
popups (title is not centered, left and right words are so big)
leftPanel ok - logged user image with presence status at top and opens presences when clicked, settings icon at bottom
right panel (check icon done with computed value, maybe a more simple solution)
contact page (circle images, empty avatar image when there is no image)
contact page - when do a global search, show Add popup when clicked instead of contact details (actually decide it when person is not in addressbook)
contact page - make size smaller for letter titles
contact page - for ContactDeails and Edit popups, fix image and icons, please compare with real SO mobile (can send images)
contact page - try to fit ContactDetails and Edit popups in one screen as in real SO mobile
dialpad page - fix keypad and number area
presences page- make bottom buttons not full size in width
Conference - fix and put conference URL in page
